                Ever meet faeries when you were a small child? Sophie did. She
                has seen them many times since, but they have been too skittish
                about her approaches.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is, until nightmarish fey kidnap a neighbor child. One she
                babysat often. Now, pursued by the same fey, she enters a
                dangerous world where faeries fear knife wielding creatures that
                can command the very earth she walks upon.
              </p>
              <p>
                She must avoid their curses, their attempts to steal her person
                and her memories all to rescue a small child that no one, not
                even her parents, knows is missing.
